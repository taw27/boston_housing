## Description
First project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree to get familiarized with techniques for training, testing, evaluating and optimizing models using sklearn and develop basic intuitions. 

 + _Uses coeficiant of determination, R2, as performance metrics_
 + _Splits shuffled data set into training and testing sets_
 + _Uses Grid Search to optimise decision tree model_
 + _Uses the optimised model to provide predictions for a set of example client data_
 + _Comments on the viability of the model on a real world setting_
